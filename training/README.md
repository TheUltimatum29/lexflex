# AWS Lex Training
### Understanding the business case of conversational bots
Conversational bots are end to end, and engage the customer. There are 8 different components that make up the entire solution as seen below:</br>
* **Speech to Intent** - This is the speech recognition engine and the natural language understanding engine which take care of consuming the voice captured and translating that into the "Intent" for which you design the bot to handle
* **Dialog Management** - part of the solution that maintains context (more later) and allows for variations of the dialogue to occur but still handle the "Intent"
* **Deployment** - deployment is referencing the simplicity of a one-click option and delivery of each bot, meaning that you can easily iterate and adjust as you go along. There is a simple UI that goes with AWS Lex.
* **Scale** - scalability comes with AWS, but specifically Lex was designed to be auto-managed so whether you are processing 5 conversations or 10,000 the environment scales to handle the workload.
* **Business Logic** - More to come on this.
